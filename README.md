# NBA Star Players' Influence on Attendance

After a long off season of trades, the Los Angeeles Lakers have a competent roster that can win the NBA championship. The roster includes plenty of former and current star players, and having such players has significantly raised my interest in attending a home game. 


## Goal

While I previously never had much of an interest in attending an NBA game, this new urge has made me wonder if this is a common phenomena amongst other NBA attendees. Thus, the goal of this project is to gather data about NBA attendance and see if there is any significant change in home attendance with the addition or subtraction of star players.


## Methods

In order to analyze the strength/influence that NBA star players had on attracting fans to see live games, the definition of a "star" player had to be defined. For the sake of this project, I decided to define star players as the top 50 best players for each respective year between 2005 to 2019. 

In order to gather information on attendance, rosters, and star players, I pulled data from ESPN and NBA.com. 


## Results

With an Î± = 0.05, there was a significant difference in aggregate percentage change in attedance between teams with a negative change in the amount of star players and teams with no change.

## Limitations & Assumptions

There were a number of variables that I kept constant for this project. Firstly, I did not account for variability in the influence/popularity of star players; I assumed that all star players have equal attracting power to attendees. Additionally, I did not account for the possibility of sellouts, and assumed ticket sales to be a continuous variable.
